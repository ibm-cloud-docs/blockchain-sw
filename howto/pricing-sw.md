This guide helps you understand the pricing model for {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform v2.1.2, and how much you will pay when you develop and grow your blockchain network of peers, ordering service, and Certificate Authorities components, which are based on Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.4.

## License
{: #ibp-software-pricing-license}

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.2 delivers the components that are needed to run a blockchain network on your own infrastructure using Kubernetes. You can access your [My IBM dashboard](https://myibm.ibm.com/dashboard/){: external} to obtain your entitlement key for the offering which is required in order to deploy the release. With this offering, you are responsible for procuring and provisioning your own Kubernetes cluster on one of the [Supported Platforms](/docs/blockchain-sw?topic=blockchain-sw-console-ocp-about#console-ocp-about-prerequisites). Technical support from IBM Blockchain is included in the offering.

## Pricing
{: #ibp-software-pricing-pricing}

The pricing of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.2 is based on the number of Virtual Processor Cores (VPCs) used. A VPC, or vCPU, can be either a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual server, or a physical processor core in a non-partitioned server. You must obtain a licensed entitlement for each VPC made available to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. The number of vCPU or CPUs that are required can vary depending on your infrastructure, network design and performance requirements.

If you are using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can read more about  VPCs (CPUs) in that platform, see  [Allocating Node Resources](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-resources-configuring.html){: external}.
Note that 1 `core` in OpenShift is equivalent to 1 vCPU in {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform.

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.2 offering also includes the ability to download and run just the peer, orderer, CA, and smart contract container images without the console. This is an advanced option for customers who are experienced with the Hyperledger Fabric processes for deploying and running the nodes and includes limited support for those images.

Various licensing options are available. For more information, please [Contact us](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-37672){: external}.
